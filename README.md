# Bug-Report-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning

A Linear Regression model can be trained to analyze bug reports and provide an output that indicates the clarity of the report. The model can be built using a supervised learning approach, where historical data on bug reports and their clarity ratings are used to train the model.

The input data for the model can include various attributes of a bug report, such as the description of the bug, the severity level, the priority, the date of submission, and the category of the bug. These attributes can be used to build a feature set that represents the bug report.

The output of the model can be a numerical value that represents the clarity of the bug report. This value can range from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates complete lack of clarity and 1 indicates perfect clarity. The model can use a variety of techniques to compute this value, such as calculating the distance between the feature set of the report and the feature sets of other reports that have been rated for clarity.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to analyze new bug reports and provide a clarity score for each report. This score can be used by developers and testers to prioritize bug fixes and improve the overall quality of the software. In addition, the model can be refined over time as more data on bug reports and their clarity ratings becomes available.
